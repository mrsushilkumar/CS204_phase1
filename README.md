## Input file
In the Input file we have to put machine code of program whatever we have to performed.    
we have some machine code of program( to  find nth fibbonacci number,bubble sort,sum of array )  

## Output file
In the Output text file we have update value of all the resister and value  memory address.  

## myRISCVSim.cpp file
In the myRISCVSim.cpp all the functions(fetch(),decode(),execute(),mem(),writeback()) performed continuously untill instruction will not end.

## how to compile and run-

1-> save all the file in same folder (input.mc ,output.txt, myRISCVSim.cpp ).    
2-> which fuction you have to perform make .mc file and save it in input file.  
3-> open myRISCVSim.cpp file compile and run it.  
4-> after running of programm all resister value and value at memory address updated in output text file.
